      body: [
        `Macro Meals was born from a simple frustration: the difficulty of maintaining specific nutritional targets while eating out or ordering in. Our founder, a fitness enthusiast and busy professional, struggled to find restaurant meals that would fit within their macronutrient goals without spending hours researching nutritional information.`,
        `After countless conversations with nutritionists, fitness coaches, and everyday people trying to maintain healthy eating habits, we realized there was a gap in the market. Traditional calorie-tracking apps were focused on home cooking and manual logging, while restaurant finders weren’t considering nutritional needs.`,
        `In 2024, we assembled a team of nutrition experts, software developers, and user experience designers to create a solution that bridges this gap. The result is Macro Meals – an innovative platform that combines precise nutritional tracking with real-world food options.`,
